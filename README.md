OOP paradigms were used to model this simple class to avoid repetition of code and to produce a well-structured and scalable code.

They include:

## 1. Inheritance

An animal Parent class was created which all the classes inherited from to avoid re-implementing the same functionality, to make the code simplified making it easier to make changes to the code, and it allowed me to make use of another OOP paradign 'Polymorphism'.

## 2. Abstraction

Abstract methods were used in the neccessary places to prevent misuse of some classes.

## 3. Polymorphism

Polymorphism was used to enforce method overriding in to classes that had different but similar methods.

## 4. Encapsulation

Encapsulation was used to improve code security by making some methods and properties of an object private.
